## Abstract

This application is a virtual recipe database where users can browse and save recipes for later use! The user is able to view all recipes, add and view their favorite recipes in the favorites section, as well as add and view recipes in the weekly recipes section. Users can use the live search bar at the top of the page to find their meal by name and / or ingredient! If the recipe is no longer of use, the user can delete the recipe card from the favorites and / or weekly views.
